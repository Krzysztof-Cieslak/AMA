Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Why I hate .Net. Whatever.

You can also reach me on Twitter: [@k_cieslak](https://twitter.com/k_cieslak), read my [blog](http://kcieslak.io) or take a look at my [photo gallery](https://500px.com/KrzysztofCieslak). Also from time to time I live code or talk with people at [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/k_cieslak)

### Who am I?

Hey!

My name is Krzysztof (Chris), and I'm a software developer currently working as a researcher at [GitHub Next](https://githubnext.com/), working on future of the software development and on tools such as [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

Additionally, I'm an active member of the F# OSS community - I'm the founder of [Ionide](http://ionide.io/) organization, author and maintainer of multiple developers toolings projects such as [Forge](https://github.com/ionide/Forge), [Fornax](https://github.com/ionide/Fornax) or [FsAutoComplete](https://github.com/fsharp/FsAutoComplete). 
I've also created an F# web development framework called [Saturn](https://github.com/SaturnFramework/Saturn) and contributed to many other OSS projects.

I often travel the world and [speak at software development conferences](https://sessionize.com/krzysztof-cieslak/) - my favourite topics include OSS sustainability, design of developer tools, and functional programming.
